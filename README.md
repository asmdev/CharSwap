# CharSwap
A Mod for Crosscode

## Installation
This mod requires the CCLoader Mod for Crosscode found [here](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader)
It is highly recommended that you backup any saves that you are not willing to lose before using any mods.

To install the mod, download it as a zip folder then extract the folder. Drag the resulting CharSwap-master folder into your CrossCode/assets/mods folder. Launch CrossCode and enjoy.

## Usage
To switch between characters use the following key commands:

Alt-T - Lea

Alt-Y - Emilie

Alt-U - Trony

Alt-I - Schneider

Alt-O - Apollo

Alt-P - Joern

Alt-G - Shizuka

Alt-H - Hlin

Alt-J - Beowulf

Alt-K - Buggy

Alt-L - Sergey?

Alt-N - A random Triblader that was in the game files

Note that most characters do not have a full implemention since it was not originally programmed into the game. Some characters are missing sprites. Hopefully, with future updates, these issues will be resolved.
